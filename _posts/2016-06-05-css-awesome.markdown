"CSS is awesome" is a joke among web designers where the text "CSS is awesome" overflows
a specified area. Because sometimes CSS does what you don't expect. For giggles I
decided that today's webpage would be exactly that.

But â€” little did I know that there is
an updated version of the joke with a 3D effect! So while the regular one was
easy to recreate, the 3D one was way more tricky. I had to use all kinds of css transforms
and clever hiding to get the same effet, but [here is my take on CSS is awesome][todays-page]!
