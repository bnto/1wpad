Today is something that will help you remember that important
task you've got to do later. I'm talking about sticky notes! 

Just type your message into the sticky note, bookmark the page and close the tab.
Go for a walk, do something productive or go have a drink with your friends.
Your message will still be there for you after you come back!

Creating a sticky note completely in CSS was fun. I had to use all kinds of
neat little tricks to get the folding and the cool shadow effects. Then I used
a _\<textarea>_ element where you can input your message. And thanks to the magic
of internet cookies, your browser remembers the note you left so you don't have to!
Also, today's page is the first one using Javascript. With many more to come!
