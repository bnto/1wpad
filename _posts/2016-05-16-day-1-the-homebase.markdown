Today is day uno.

Each day I will build a new page, update the homebase (which is today's webpage!) and add a nifty little blog post like this one.
Initially the blog was hard coded and static. A mess.
So, after a couple hours I was able to put together a CMS (namely Jekyll) and sent everything to Github.
Success!
